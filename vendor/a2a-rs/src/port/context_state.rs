/// Separate from [`AsyncConversationStore`] because the two are independently

/// told the user's name, and one that carries the whole conversation need not
/// keep anything apart from it. Wiring them as one port would make each of
/// those configurations pull in the other.
///
/// ## The caller argument
///
/// As on [`AsyncConversationStore`], every method takes the authenticated
/// principal's id. It does two jobs here. Context-scoped keys are protected the
/// same way the transcript is — whoever holds a `context_id` would otherwise
/// read what was remembered in it — and [`StateScope::User`] keys are filed
/// under the principal itself, so it is the storage key rather than a check.
///
/// A `user:` key with no principal is [`A2AError::InvalidParams`]: there is
/// nothing to file it under, and storing it against the context instead would
/// promise a lifetime it does not have.
