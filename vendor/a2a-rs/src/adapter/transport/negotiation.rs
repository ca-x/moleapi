//! Client-side transport negotiation.
//!
//! A [`TransportFactory`] knows how to build a [`Transport`] for one wire
//! protocol from an agent interface. A [`TransportNegotiator`] holds an ordered
//! set of factories and, given an [`AgentCard`], picks the first interface it can
//! satisfy — ranked by **client preference** (factory registration order), which
//! dominates the card's own `preferred_transport`.
//!
//! This is composition-at-the-edge: the application assembles a negotiator with
//! exactly the transports it compiled in, then calls [`connect`] (or
//! [`TransportNegotiator::negotiate`]) to obtain a ready `Box<dyn Transport>`.
//!
//! A [`ClientConfig`] carries the settings that are not derivable from the card —
//! credentials and request timeout — through negotiation, so a negotiated client
//! is configured exactly like a hand-built one. Without it, authentication would
//! only be reachable by bypassing negotiation entirely.
